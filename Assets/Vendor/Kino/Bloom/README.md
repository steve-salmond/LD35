onto rendered images.

*Bloom* is part of the *Kino* effect suite. Please see the [GitHub
repositories][Kino] for further information about the suite.

System Requirements
-------------------

Unity 5.1 or later versions.

Effect Properties
-----------------

![Inspector][Inspector]

- **Threshold** - Filters out pixels under this level of brightness. This value
  should be given in the gamma space (as used in the color picker).

- **Soft Knee** - Makes transition between under/over-threshold gradual (0 =
  hard threshold, 1 = soft threshold).

- **Intensity** - Total intensity of the effect.

- **Radius** - Controls the extent of veiling effects. The value is not related
  to screen size and can be controlled in a resolution-independent fashion.

- **High Quality** - Controls the filter quality and the buffer resolution. On
  mobile platforms, it might strongly affect the performance of the effect,
  therefore itâ€™s recommended to be unchecked when running on mobile devices.

- **Anti Flicker** - Sometimes the effect introduces strong flickers (flashing
  noise). This option is used to suppress them with a noise reduction filter.

No Backward Compatibility
-------------------------

This version (v2) is not compatible with the previous versions. You can't simply
upgrade the previous implementation or use two different versions in the same
project. Sorry for the inconvenience!
